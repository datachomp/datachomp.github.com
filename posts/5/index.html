<p>What a great link bait title right? The purpose of this post is to give my reasoning for joining the<a href="http://www.red-gate.com/our-company/about/community-relations/friends-of-rg"> Friends of Red Gate</a> program. So without further ado:</p>

<p><strong>Education &ndash;</strong> I simply love software development with all my heart. Much of this love is channeled towards learning. In the SQL Server arena there are a couple resources that just stand out above the others&hellip; I&rsquo;m talking about <a href="http://www.sqlservercentral.com/">SQL Server Central</a>, <a href="http://www.simple-talk.com/">Simple-Talk</a>, the wealth of information that Brad McGehee(<a href="http://www.bradmcgehee.com/">blog </a>| <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/bradmcgehee">twitter</a>) puts out, Grant Fritchney(<a href="http://www.scarydba.com/">blog </a>| <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/GFritchey">twitter</a>), and the <a href="http://www.red-gate.com/our-company/about/book-store/">various books</a>. It became quite apparent that a lot of what has made me such a successful DBA is because Red Gate shares that same passion for building great software.</p>

<p><strong>Community &ndash;</strong> Another manifestation of this love shows itself in community events. Whenever I put on an event or attend one, there is one company I know of that consistently steps up to the plate. Red Gate. Even during slower economic times, when some sponsors required coaxing and justification, when it came to community, Red Gate was always on board. While they are a company and these events are advertising or promotional opportunities, that aspect of it never comes on. No matter how big or how small the event, I always feel like they genuinely want all of us to learn and be better at our craft. I have a tremendous amount of respect for that company on this alone.</p>

<p><strong>Tools &ndash;</strong> When I first downloaded and installed the beta of <a href="http://www.red-gate.com/products/sql-development/sql-source-control/">SQL Source Control</a>, my knees became weak. In the chaotic world of database change management and DDL triggers, this tool absolutely blew my mind. When I started playing with this tool, it was like I had just won a lifetime supply of pizza and cupcakes. Everyone has schema/data compare tools or backup tools, but a native source control tool? Way to step up to the plate Red Gate. I wanted to email customer support and ask for SQL Source Controls ring size because I was hooked. We use TFS at work, but on the side I use a combination of Subversion and GIT&hellip; SQL Source control doesn&rsquo;t even care &ndash; it just does its job. The quality, ease of use, and the need that tool fills made me think that Red Gate loves software development just as much as I do.</p>

<p>I am not a salesman and I don&rsquo;t try to be. I&rsquo;m not trying to sell you Red Gate tools. All I can do is tell you how they have worked for me and let you make the best decision for your situation. One message I do hope I convey is that the next time you are at an event that Red Gate sponsors or take advantage of any of their various learning resources, take a moment to thank them. They do a lot of things in front of and behind the scenes to help all of us reach success without any of us being forced to buy their tools and I find that amount of passion in a company both admirable and rare.</p>

<p>The question emails are starting to pile in (which is a good thing!) so this post is basically a way to centralize links/answers. In the show, I say a few times &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll see this later&rdquo; (like with SQL Server Profiler) and we never see it&hellip; that was mostly my fault. For some reason I kept thinking I would be able to squeeze 5 hours of content into 1 hour and was wrong. If there are aspects of SQL Server that you would like to see more of, as well as real world problems that you may have and would like to see solutions to, then let <a href="http://help.tekpub.com/">Tekpub know</a>. We&rsquo;ll see if we can hack out real world solutions wrapped in a warm blanket of statistics and opinion.</p>

<p><strong>Questions:</strong>*<br/>
<strong>How do you get the stats to appear in the &ldquo;messages&rdquo; window?</strong><br/>
Those stats come from the following commands:<br/>
SET STATISTICS IO ON;<br/>
SET STATISTICS TIME ON;<br/>
If you don&rsquo;t want to turn it on for every query/window, you can do what I do and set them to always be on in Management studio, you can do this by :<br/>
Tools &ndash;> Options &ndash;> Query Execution &ndash;> SQL Server &ndash;> Advanced<br/>
then check:<br/>
SET STATISTICS IO ON;<br/>
SET STATISTICS TIME ON;
<strong>Lock Pages in Memory, is that always good?</strong><br/>
No, and perhaps I glossed over that section too much or technology changes too fast. While Lock Pages in Memory can be a wonderful setting, there are of course times when it can be pretty bad. You can read more about that here: <a href="http://sqlserverperformance.wordpress.com/2011/02/14/sql-server-and-the-lock-pages-in-memory-right-in-windows-server/">http://sqlserverperformance.wordpress.com/2011/02/14/sql-server-and-the-lock-pages-in-memory-right-in-windows-server/</a>
<strong>Why no filtered index on Posts?</strong><br/>
In our first scenario, to get the front page up&hellip; we just went with the index that the engine suggested.. That got us up and running which is great, but there is room for improvement. To me, filtered indexes are more of a business rule decision and with enough time, if we saw that the load was heavy and predictable enough, we would have likely thrown a filtered index to satisfy the front page query.</p>

<p><strong>What were you using for &ldquo;Intellisense&rdquo; in management studio?</strong> I am not extremely big on intellisense in general, however, I am kind of big on formatting and having a variety of administrative snippets at my finger tips. I use a 3rd party tool called Red-Gate SQL Prompt and have it moderately customized. Keep in mind, I really only use this type of product on data sets I am not very familiar with like the one in this demo. On datasets that I know pretty well, I find intellisense to really just get in the way and make me angry.</p>

<p><strong>And the database?</strong> I am still working on a way to make the DB available. It is roughly 40GB raw, and 4GB compressed. If having the data is a big deal to you, hit me up on email and we can work something out (S3,FTP, yada yada yada)</p>

<p>So, in <a href="http://blog.wekeroad.com/helpy-stuff/and-i-shall-call-it-massive">Rob Conery&rsquo;s example</a> of using multiple args in a query</p>

<p><code></p>

<pre><code>var tbl = new Products();
var products = tbl.All(where: "CategoryID = @0 AND UnitPrice &gt; @1", orderBy: "ProductName", limit: 20, args: 5,20);
</code></pre>

<p></code>
It makes the args appear to be this completely bad ass and intelligent command that knows exactly when and where to parse/apply the values. Well, in the real world versions of Massive the compiler doesn&rsquo;t take to kindly to that sort of syntax.</p>

<p>args: is a parameter of type object [] so the way I use multiple params is as follows:
<code></p>

<pre><code>object[] queryargs = {"Okapi", "online"};
var DBBasics = table.All(where: "WHERE ServerName=@0 and status = @1", args: queryargs );
</code></pre>

<p></code>
and low and behold the magic happens.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h1></h1>

<p>If you read over my first post on this you probably have some questions going through your mind&hellip;. I know I did&hellip; So lets ask them:</p>

<p><strong>Rob, your queries make no sense to me because I have no idea about this &lsquo;drinks&rsquo; table you&rsquo;re hitting.</strong><br/>
I agree. When I start to play with something I tend to use very simple databases that I know for simplicity. From here on, I&rsquo;ll be using <a href="http://msftdbprodsamples.codeplex.com/releases/view/59211">Adventure Works 2008 R2</a></p>

<p><strong>All this stuff is dynamic and I don&rsquo;t know how to deal with it.</strong> I&rsquo;m just as strongly typed as the next guy so this was an emotional hurdle. But we&rsquo;re not here for therapy so lets code using one of my favorite examples &ndash; Credit Cards!<br/>
Class:
<code></p>

<pre><code>public class CreditCard : DynamicModel
    {  public CreditCard()  : base("AW_Sales_ConnStr")
        { 
            PrimaryKeyField = "CreditCardID"; 
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p></code>
ViewModel:
<code></p>

<pre><code>public class CreditCardViewModel
    {public IEnumerable&lt;Cards&gt;{ get; set; } }
</code></pre>

<p></code>
Controller:
<code></p>

<pre><code>public ActionResult Index()
{
      var table = new CreditCard();
      var cards = table.All();

    var viewModel = new CreditCardViewModel
    {
          Cards = cards
         };
    return View(viewModel);
}
</code></pre>

<p></code>
View:
<code></p>

<pre><code>@model Kona.Web.Models.CreditCardViewModel
@{ViewBag.Title = "Adventure Works Card Stealer";}

&lt;table&gt;
@foreach (var item in Model.Cards)
{
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;@item.CardType&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;@item.CardNumber&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;@item.ExpMonth&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;@item.ExpYear&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
}&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
</code></pre>

<p></code></p>

<p>So 2 seconds after this works, I hope that you are feeling very uncomfortable about presenting Credit Card numbers or even pulling them. That is a good thing&hellip;. So since we have a special case where we care a whole bunch about not returning that data&hellip; lets change our controller:
<code></p>

<pre><code>var table = new CreditCard();
//var cards = table.All();
var cards = table.Query(@"SELECT CardType, ExpMonth ,ExpYear from CreditCard");
</code></pre>

<p></code>
Sweet! it compiles, we&rsquo;re ready to check in and go grab a beer right? Heh, nope&hellip;. refresh your app:<br/>
<em>&lsquo;System.Dynamic.ExpandoObject&rsquo; does not contain a definition for &lsquo;CardNumber&rsquo;</em></p>

<p>So we update our view&hellip;.
<code></p>

<pre><code>{
@item.CardType
@item.ExpMonth
@item.ExpYear
}
</code></pre>

<p></code></p>

<p>and all is well again.</p>

<p>Make no mistake about it&hellip; Massive will give you all the rope you want to easily swing around your apps data jungle&hellip; it will also give you all the rope you want to hang yourself if that is what you choose to do with it. Which is precisely why I like it. I feel like Entity Framework4 (<a href="http://thisdeveloperslife.com/post/1-0-8-motivation">And don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I like EF4</a>) is a micromanaging boss that wants to check my every move. Massive is like the boss that gives me a task and trusts that I&rsquo;ll get it done.</p>

<p>Welcome to dynamic!</p>

<p>One last bit because this is getting lengthy:<br/>
<strong>Credit cards in AdventureWorks 2008 R2 are locked into a Sales schema and I can&rsquo;t figure out how make my class take &ldquo;advantage&rdquo; of that</strong><br/>
This is a fun thing we DBA&rsquo;s like to do for the sole purpose of driving AppDev&rsquo;s nuts (with just some oh so minor security and organizational reasoning behind it). In our Credit Card model we can update to specify the TableName. Also, I use a special connection string:
<code></p>

<pre><code>public CreditCard() : base("AW_Sales_ConnStr")
        { 
            TableName = "[Sales].[CreditCard]";
            PrimaryKeyField = "CreditCardID"; 
        }
</code></pre>

<p></code></p>

<p>That setting in the base() maps to my web.config:
<code></p>

<pre><code>add name="AW_Sales_ConnStr" connectionString="Data Source=localhost;Initial Catalog=AdventureWorks2008R2;User ID=aw_Kona_Sales;Password=Sales_Password;Application Name=KonaSales;" providerName="System.Data.SqlClient"
</code></pre>

<p></code></p>

<p>and in SQL Server this maps to the Sales Schema (key part being the specification of a Default_Schema:
<code></p>

<pre><code>CREATE USER [aw_Kona_Sales] FOR LOGIN [aw_Kona_Sales] WITH DEFAULT_SCHEMA=[Sales]
</code></pre>

<p></code></p>

<p>Last thing, I promise &hellip; In my first post, I included how the commands were rendering out in the SQL Server. I didn&rsquo;t this time because this edition is more focused on a &ldquo;getting things done in MVC&rdquo; side of things.<br/>
Trust me, I am a DBA first ( and I imagine some of my code probably shows it) and I am still profiling every single thing I do with Massive looking for problems.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h1></h1>

<p><a href="http://blog.wekeroad.com/">Rob Conery</a> has created a new ORM of sorts   and as a DBA, I must say I like what I see so far.</p>

<p>Getting started:  So some of you might be noob programmers like myself and after adding Massive to your MVC application via Nuget you become lost in space because it doesn&rsquo;t work.  The fix to this is rather easy,  just check the properties of the  Massive.cs file and make sure its build action is set to Compile&hellip; you might want to change the namespace as well depending on how picky you are with namespace juggling.</p>

<p>We DBA&rsquo;s are a particularly picky bunch and one of the things we hate about ORM&#8217;s  is something called &lsquo;plan cache poisoning&rsquo;.  Want to know why your DBA hated Linq to SQL until  .NET 4 came out?  One of the reasons is &lsquo;plan cache poisoning&#8217;  which I will call PCP for short.   When you make a query to the database SQL Server compiles the that query into a plan so that the next time you go to run  it&hellip; it doesn&rsquo;t have to compile a new plan&hellip; it just pulls from its cache.  When it comes to  linq-sql and EF before  .net 4&hellip;.  they would pass a new string length depending upon the size of the string you are looking for.  So, if you have a table of contacts and want to pull someone up by first name&hellip;  it would compile a plan for &#8216;Rob&rsquo;, a plan for &lsquo;Robert&rsquo;,  a plan for &lsquo;Mike&rsquo; and so forth until you have exhausted all the different name lengths.    This sucks.   With Massive your  DBA won&rsquo;t wake up in cold sweats thinking about his beloved plan cache because of your ORM.</p>

<p>To make  basic call with Massive on a Drinks Table (DrinkID, DrinkName) we do this:</p>

<pre><code>1.  var table = [new][2] Drinks&amp;#40;&amp;#41;;

2.  var drinks = table.All&amp;#40;&amp;#41;;
</code></pre>

<p>If you have done any Linq or EF you know that even a basic call like that is going to cause Linq or EF to create<br/>
the ugliest looking t-sql it can by breaking out into extent aliases God knows what else it likes to do to say &lsquo;hey look at me&#8217;<br/>
Does Massive have this problem? Nope, looking at profiler we get straight forward SQL &ndash;</p>

<pre><code>1.  SELECT * FROM DRINKS
</code></pre>

<p>Well, that&rsquo;s cool and all if you want to start barfing out tables into your app, but how often to get to exercise such negligence?<br/>
Rarely, so lets move to some conditions&hellip; lets look up a drink name:</p>

<pre><code>1.  var table = [new][2] Drinks&amp;#40;&amp;#41;;

2.  var drinks = table.All&amp;#40;where: "WHERE DrinkName=@0", args: "Fire Rock Pale Ale"&amp;#41;;
</code></pre>

<p>Knowing EF, we&rsquo;re likely going to have 15 lines of aliases and subqueries to run this most complicated of queries..<br/>
In Massive, we get:</p>

<pre><code>1.  EXEC SP_EXECUTESQL N'SELECT * FROM Drinks WHERE DrinkName=@0',N'@0 nvarchar(4000)',@=N'Fire Rock Pale Ale'
</code></pre>

<p>In addition to a simple to grok TSQL, we also start getting reusable query plans.</p>

<p>More examples to come as I start to peel back the covers a bit on this new tool.</p>

<p>There is going to be a strong disturbance in the force, Dallas Feb 21st &ndash; 25th when the <a href="http://www.sqlskills.com/">SQLSkills</a> team comes down for a Master Immersion class : <a href="http://www.sqlskills.com/Master1-Dallas-20110221.asp">http://www.sqlskills.com/Master1-Dallas-20110221.asp</a> .</p>

<p>I am not going to spend a lot of time talking about why I want to attend a class taught by Paul Randal (<a href="http://www.sqlskills.com/BLOGS/PAUL/">blog</a> | <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/paulrandal">twitter</a>) and Kimberly Tripp (<a href="http://www.sqlskills.com/BLOGS/Kimberly/">blog</a> | <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/kimberlyltripp">twitter</a>). Their body of work in both the education and SQL Server stands second to no one, so trying to go on about this just belabors the point. Simply put, if you want to be among the best, then one should find the best and learn from them.</p>

<p>Now, let us graduate to the less obvious aspect of this post, which is why I would make the best use of this knowledge.  With technical debt, you sometimes have to write SQL checks that your brain can&rsquo;t cash. This class is like adding a few 0&rsquo;s to your brain balance.   As I take in the knowledge from this class, it is going to manifest itself into a trident to attack the following issues:</p>

<p><strong>Personal: </strong> Let&rsquo;s be honest, keeping up with technology is an infinite and exhaustive grind.  Unfortunately, this can eventually create stress on one&rsquo;s work/life balance as the unending need to keep learning is often standing right in the way of the unending need to be with one&rsquo;s family. The quality and depth of this immersion event is an incredible opportunity to trade a few days in order to receive many years worth of nights. I personally think a good DBA is a &ldquo;Jack of all trades, Master of one&rdquo;&hellip; it is time I establish my mastery.</p>

<p><strong>Professional:</strong> I currently work as the lone DBA for a virtual high school. This is simply the most fascinating job I have ever had for a variety of reasons. Having never had a DBA and more the point, no solid guidance in how to do things, the situations I come across can be truly migraine-inducing. The quicker I am able diagnose the correct path,  the more time I can spend on what really matters. Things like building analysis cubes which enable our teachers and staff to quickly identify where the system is breaking down with regards to the students&#8217; education. By doing this, it creates an opportunity for system efficiencies and satisfying end user experiences which are far more interesting and worthwhile than trying to continually identify where our SQL Servers are breaking down.</p>

<p><strong>Community:</strong> As a founder of the Oklahoma City SQL Server Developers Group, what you teach me doesn&rsquo;t stop at my front lobe. You essentially essentially aid me in becoming Johnny SQL-Seed, spreading my knowledge to our community as I continue to give more talks to our group and region. In addition, my hope is that the networking from this class will enable us to find more speakers, as well as bring different points of views and technological diversity to our meetings. Without question, being involved in the SQL community is a lot of fun. However, the downside is that while I am organizing or speaking, I tend to miss out on a lot of content. This class is a chance for me to participate instead of provide, and I can&rsquo;t wait to be immersed in this baptism of SQL.</p>

<p>In closing, this is an incredible opportunity put out there by the <a href="http://www.sqlskills.com/">SQLSkills</a> team and I truly hope to INNER JOIN them in Dallas.</p>

<p>Deploying ASP MVC3 to shared hosting isn&rsquo;t always sunshine and lollipops.   Though my beloved hosting company <a href="http://www.arvixe.com/851.html">Arvixe</a> is pretty cutting edge,  it didn&rsquo;t have (and I didn&rsquo;t request) that they hop on MVC3 or its beta.   Regardless, I went to deploy an MVC3 app and it blew up because of a variety of dependencies.   As <a href="http://datachomp.com/archives/early-mvc-pitfalls-shared-hosting-and-action-link/" title="discovered">discovered</a> in early MVC2 work, you have to set some assemblies to &lsquo;copy local&rsquo; to get it to work on shared hosting.</p>

<p>The list of assemblies to set to copy local = true is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Microsoft.Web.Infrastructure</li>
<li>System.Web.Helpers</li>
<li>System.Web.Mvc</li>
<li>System.Web.Razor</li>
<li>System.Web.Webpages</li>
<li>System.Web.WebPages.Deployment</li>
<li>System.Web.Webpages.Razor</li>
</ul>
