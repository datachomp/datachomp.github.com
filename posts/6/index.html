  <div class="entry-content"><h1></h1>

<p><a href="http://blog.wekeroad.com/">Rob Conery</a> has created a new ORM of sorts   and as a DBA, I must say I like what I see so far.</p>

<p>Getting started:  So some of you might be noob programmers like myself and after adding Massive to your MVC application via Nuget you become lost in space because it doesn&rsquo;t work.  The fix to this is rather easy,  just check the properties of the  Massive.cs file and make sure its build action is set to Compile&hellip; you might want to change the namespace as well depending on how picky you are with namespace juggling.</p>

<p>We DBA&rsquo;s are a particularly picky bunch and one of the things we hate about ORM&#8217;s  is something called &lsquo;plan cache poisoning&rsquo;.  Want to know why your DBA hated Linq to SQL until  .NET 4 came out?  One of the reasons is &lsquo;plan cache poisoning&#8217;  which I will call PCP for short.   When you make a query to the database SQL Server compiles the that query into a plan so that the next time you go to run  it&hellip; it doesn&rsquo;t have to compile a new plan&hellip; it just pulls from its cache.  When it comes to  linq-sql and EF before  .net 4&hellip;.  they would pass a new string length depending upon the size of the string you are looking for.  So, if you have a table of contacts and want to pull someone up by first name&hellip;  it would compile a plan for &#8216;Rob&rsquo;, a plan for &lsquo;Robert&rsquo;,  a plan for &lsquo;Mike&rsquo; and so forth until you have exhausted all the different name lengths.    This sucks.   With Massive your  DBA won&rsquo;t wake up in cold sweats thinking about his beloved plan cache because of your ORM.</p>

<p>To make  basic call with Massive on a Drinks Table (DrinkID, DrinkName) we do this:</p>

<pre><code>1.  var table = [new][2] Drinks&amp;#40;&amp;#41;;

2.  var drinks = table.All&amp;#40;&amp;#41;;
</code></pre>

<p>If you have done any Linq or EF you know that even a basic call like that is going to cause Linq or EF to create<br/>
the ugliest looking t-sql it can by breaking out into extent aliases God knows what else it likes to do to say &lsquo;hey look at me&#8217;<br/>
Does Massive have this problem? Nope, looking at profiler we get straight forward SQL &ndash;</p>

<pre><code>1.  SELECT * FROM DRINKS
</code></pre>

<p>Well, that&rsquo;s cool and all if you want to start barfing out tables into your app, but how often to get to exercise such negligence?<br/>
Rarely, so lets move to some conditions&hellip; lets look up a drink name:</p>

<pre><code>1.  var table = [new][2] Drinks&amp;#40;&amp;#41;;

2.  var drinks = table.All&amp;#40;where: "WHERE DrinkName=@0", args: "Fire Rock Pale Ale"&amp;#41;;
</code></pre>

<p>Knowing EF, we&rsquo;re likely going to have 15 lines of aliases and subqueries to run this most complicated of queries..<br/>
In Massive, we get:</p>

<pre><code>1.  EXEC SP_EXECUTESQL N'SELECT * FROM Drinks WHERE DrinkName=@0',N'@0 nvarchar(4000)',@=N'Fire Rock Pale Ale'
</code></pre>

<p>In addition to a simple to grok TSQL, we also start getting reusable query plans.</p>

<p>More examples to come as I start to peel back the covers a bit on this new tool.</p>

<p>Here are some of the tools I use for Security and Code analysis  (I bet you didn&rsquo;t see that coming from!)</p>

<p>WebConfig Analyzer &ndash; you can do a stand alone download and feed your webconfig into it</p>

<p><a href="http://www.wireshark.org/">WireShark</a> Use this to see what is going on on the network.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.fiddler2.com/fiddler2/">Fiddler </a>&ndash; Great for https inspection.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.mavitunasecurity.com/communityedition/">Netsparker</a> Use it to hit test sites and see if throws back anything useful.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.backtrack-linux.org/">BackTrack 4</a> Not sure what needs to be said here other than the best way to get a white hat, is to take a black hat and bleach it.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyID=917023f6-d5b7-41bb-bbc0-411a7d66cf3c">FXCop</a> I tun this against my code when I want to feel stupid and see how many places I&rsquo;ve goofed.  Things putting getters and setters on read only data. Doh!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.red-gate.com/products/dotnet-development/reflector/">Reflector</a> Other peoples code and programs look pretty fun when uncompiled. Likewise, this is also good for making sure you didn&rsquo;t leave any sensitive information in your own binaries.</p>

<p>FireFox add-ons:</p>

<p><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/viewstate-size/">ViewState</a></p>

<p><a href="http://getfirebug.com/">FireBug</a></p>

<p>There is going to be a strong disturbance in the force, Dallas Feb 21st &ndash; 25th when the <a href="http://www.sqlskills.com/">SQLSkills</a> team comes down for a Master Immersion class : <a href="http://www.sqlskills.com/Master1-Dallas-20110221.asp">http://www.sqlskills.com/Master1-Dallas-20110221.asp</a> .</p>

<p>I am not going to spend a lot of time talking about why I want to attend a class taught by Paul Randal (<a href="http://www.sqlskills.com/BLOGS/PAUL/">blog</a> | <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/paulrandal">twitter</a>) and Kimberly Tripp (<a href="http://www.sqlskills.com/BLOGS/Kimberly/">blog</a> | <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/kimberlyltripp">twitter</a>). Their body of work in both the education and SQL Server stands second to no one, so trying to go on about this just belabors the point. Simply put, if you want to be among the best, then one should find the best and learn from them.</p>

<p>Now, let us graduate to the less obvious aspect of this post, which is why I would make the best use of this knowledge.  With technical debt, you sometimes have to write SQL checks that your brain can&rsquo;t cash. This class is like adding a few 0&rsquo;s to your brain balance.   As I take in the knowledge from this class, it is going to manifest itself into a trident to attack the following issues:</p>

<p><strong>Personal: </strong> Let&rsquo;s be honest, keeping up with technology is an infinite and exhaustive grind.  Unfortunately, this can eventually create stress on one&rsquo;s work/life balance as the unending need to keep learning is often standing right in the way of the unending need to be with one&rsquo;s family. The quality and depth of this immersion event is an incredible opportunity to trade a few days in order to receive many years worth of nights. I personally think a good DBA is a &ldquo;Jack of all trades, Master of one&rdquo;&hellip; it is time I establish my mastery.</p>

<p><strong>Professional:</strong> I currently work as the lone DBA for a virtual high school. This is simply the most fascinating job I have ever had for a variety of reasons. Having never had a DBA and more the point, no solid guidance in how to do things, the situations I come across can be truly migraine-inducing. The quicker I am able diagnose the correct path,  the more time I can spend on what really matters. Things like building analysis cubes which enable our teachers and staff to quickly identify where the system is breaking down with regards to the students&#8217; education. By doing this, it creates an opportunity for system efficiencies and satisfying end user experiences which are far more interesting and worthwhile than trying to continually identify where our SQL Servers are breaking down.</p>

<p><strong>Community:</strong> As a founder of the Oklahoma City SQL Server Developers Group, what you teach me doesn&rsquo;t stop at my front lobe. You essentially essentially aid me in becoming Johnny SQL-Seed, spreading my knowledge to our community as I continue to give more talks to our group and region. In addition, my hope is that the networking from this class will enable us to find more speakers, as well as bring different points of views and technological diversity to our meetings. Without question, being involved in the SQL community is a lot of fun. However, the downside is that while I am organizing or speaking, I tend to miss out on a lot of content. This class is a chance for me to participate instead of provide, and I can&rsquo;t wait to be immersed in this baptism of SQL.</p>

<p>In closing, this is an incredible opportunity put out there by the <a href="http://www.sqlskills.com/">SQLSkills</a> team and I truly hope to INNER JOIN them in Dallas.</p>

<p>Deploying ASP MVC3 to shared hosting isn&rsquo;t always sunshine and lollipops.   Though my beloved hosting company <a href="http://www.arvixe.com/851.html">Arvixe</a> is pretty cutting edge,  it didn&rsquo;t have (and I didn&rsquo;t request) that they hop on MVC3 or its beta.   Regardless, I went to deploy an MVC3 app and it blew up because of a variety of dependencies.   As <a href="http://datachomp.com/archives/early-mvc-pitfalls-shared-hosting-and-action-link/" title="discovered">discovered</a> in early MVC2 work, you have to set some assemblies to &lsquo;copy local&rsquo; to get it to work on shared hosting.</p>

<p>The list of assemblies to set to copy local = true is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Microsoft.Web.Infrastructure</li>
<li>System.Web.Helpers</li>
<li>System.Web.Mvc</li>
<li>System.Web.Razor</li>

<p>Disclaimer: I didn&rsquo;t write/create these exclusions&hellip;I copied them off <a href="http://stackoverflow.com" title="StackOverflow.com">Stackoverflow.com</a> Sadly, I didn&rsquo;t bookmark the link and upon quick search, there were too many svn links for me to filter through.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Jim motivated me to actually spend the extra time to track down the actual links I used.  <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/85353/best-general-svn-ignore-pattern" title="Link1">Link1</a> and  <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4375971/tortoise-svn-global-ignore-pattern" title="Link2">Link2</a></p>

<p>I use  <a href="http://ankhsvn.open.collab.net/" title="AnkhSVN">AhnkSVN</a> as my visual studio source control plugin.  I right click on the solution,  select &lsquo;subversion&rsquo;,  select &lsquo;solution properties&rsquo;.  That brings up a box and you will want to click &lsquo;add&rsquo;.  From there,  select  svn.Ignore  and copy/paste the below:</p>

<p>Solution Level:</p>

<p>*.csproj.user Bin obj Obj Release debug Debug release</p>

<p>Note: I don&rsquo;t use Reshaper, if you do, there are other exclusions you will want to add</p>

<p>In <a href="http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/" title="TortoiseSVN">Tortoisesvn</a>,  my exclusion list is :</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h1></h1>

<p>Many times I see abuse of the Return Value in a stored procedure. What I mean by this is essentially using the Return Value to send back say an identity value or something like:
<code></p>

<pre><code>SET @TheID = SCOPE_IDENTITY();
RETURN @TheID
</code></pre>

<p></code></p>

<p>My personal thought on the matter is that you use the Return Values are for determining the execution health of the procedure you called, and that to get an ID value either from a record set or an OUTPUT parameter. This allows a separation of concerns and provides a way for an application to completely understand the intent of the procedure that executed. Lets jump to the code to see what I mean:
<code></p>

<pre><code>--drop table dbo.pizza
CREATE TABLE Pizza (pizzaid TINYINT IDENTITY(1,1), pizzasize VARCHAR(10), numberoftoppings TINYINT, pizzaname VARCHAR(40) )

CREATE PROCEDURE dbo.asp_InsertNewPizza
    (@PizzaSize VARCHAR(10),@NumberofToppings TINYINT,@pizzaName VARCHAR(40),@PizzaID TINYINT OUTPUT
AS

BEGIN TRY
INSERT INTO dbo.Pizza (pizzaSize, NumberOftoppings,pizzaname)
VALUES (@PizzaSize, @NumberofToppings, @pizzaName)

SELECT @PizzaID = SCOPE_IDENTITY();
RETURN 0;
END Try
BEGIN Catch
    RETURN -1
END Catch
GO

DECLARE @InsertedID TINYINT, @RunOK INT;
EXEC @RunOK = dbo.asp_InsertNewPizza @pizzaSize = 'Medium',@NumberOfToppings=2, @PizzaName='Medium Cheese and Sausage', @PizzaID=@InsertedID OUT
SELECT @RunOK, @InsertedID
</code></pre>

<p></code></p>

<p>So, when we run the above code, we get a 0 for the return value (@RunOK), and a 1 for the inserted ID. Had we received a -1 for the return value, we would know that something was jacked up and not to trust the value of the OUTPUT param. Of course, like many demo&rsquo;s, this is an incredibly simple demo just to show proof of concept. We could go a huge discourse about handling failures inside the procedure, application level transactions, or any number of scenarios that might result in a &ldquo;Fine, in that case don&rsquo;t do the above&rdquo; but all that does is take away from the general message of separation of concerns and being able to quickly convey what actually happened. Lets look at this slight alteration to our operation:
<code></p>

<pre><code>CREATE PROCEDURE dbo.asp_InsertNewPizza
    (@PizzaSize VARCHAR(10),@NumberofToppings TINYINT,@pizzaName VARCHAR(40),@PizzaID TINYINT OUTPUT
AS

IF EXISTS (SELECT pizzaID FROM dbo.Pizza WHERE pizzaname = @pizzaName)
BEGIN
    SET @PizzaID = NULL;
    RETURN 1;   
END
ELSE
BEGIN TRY
    INSERT INTO dbo.Pizza (pizzaSize, NumberOftoppings,pizzaname)
    VALUES (@PizzaSize, @NumberofToppings, @pizzaName)

    SELECT @PizzaID = SCOPE_IDENTITY();
    RETURN 0;
END TRY
BEGIN CATCH
    RETURN -1
END CATCH

GO
</code></pre>

<p></code></p>

<p>Without catching the Return Values&hellip; if we get a NULL for the identity, how do we know if it is from an issue with inserting the values or an issue with a pizza name already existing? If we capture the ReturnValue and see that it is >= 0 we know that it wasn&rsquo;t from an error, but that a certain business rule had been met.</p>

<p>Well this is all good and well to us the database people, but what do we do if the app devs say it is too hard to won&rsquo;t help them. Here is just a basic call in C# with ADO.NET and how it could be used:
<code></p>

<pre><code>SqlCommand databaseCMD = new SqlCommand ("asp_InsertNewPizza", pizzaConn);

databaseCMD.CommandType = CommandType.StoredProcedure;

SqlParameter PizzaSize = databaseCMD.Parameters.Add ("@pizzaSize", SqlDbType.VarChar, 10);
PizzaSize.Direction = ParameterDirection.Input;
SqlParameter NumberOfToppings = databaseCMD.Parameters.Add ("@NumberOfToppings", SqlDbType.TinyInt);
NumberOfToppings.Direction = ParameterDirection.Input;
SqlParameter PizzaName = databaseCMD.Parameters.Add ("@PizzaName", SqlDbType.VarChar, 40);
PizzaName.Direction = ParameterDirection.Input;


SqlParameter PizzaID = databaseCMD.Parameters.Add ("@PizzaID", SqlDbType.TinyInt);
PizzaID.Direction = ParameterDirection.Output ;
SqlParameter ReturnValue = databaseCMD.Parameters.Add ("RetVal", SqlDbType.Int);
RetVal.Direction = ParameterDirection.ReturnValue;

int pizzaID;
pizzaConn.Open();

pizzaID =databaseCMD.ExecuteScalar ().ToString() ;

if (ReturnValue == 0){
ResponseWrite("The Pizza was added. The pizzaID is : " + pizzaID.ToString() );
ResponseWreite("Return Value: " + RetVal.Value);
}
else if{ ReturnValue == 1) {
ResponseWrite("Sorry friend, that pizza name already exists.");
ResponseWreite("Return Value: " + RetVal.Value);
}
else { FreakOut(); }
</code></pre>

<p></code></p>

<p>Amazon has just done something amazing&hellip; <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/free/">Amazingness</a>&hellip; They are essentially doing a conditional year free of their services. While I am a huge fan of VMWare, what Amazon is offering is something completely unmatched by VCloud or MS Azure.  (Please see Craig&rsquo;s comment as this claim has the possibility of being debunked. Thanks Craig!)</p>

<p>So what can I do with this you might ask? Here are some ideas: (I am doing these off the top of my head so feel free to criticize them by suggesting a better ideas)</p>

<ol>
<li><p>If you have never played with Linux/Ruby or anything else, here is a good/free way to to dabble without the &lsquo;will this mess up my system&rsquo; fear. Microsoft is continuing their adoption of features from these platforms and it can only benefit you to see these ideas they are using from Ruby(gems) or Apache(modularization). The more you know, the more you grow.</p></li>
<li><p>NOSQL? What is a NOSQL? Want a simple way to learn about NOSQL? Then try out Amazon&rsquo;s simpleDB. They have various demos and such you can run and play with and start trying to see what all the hype is about. Remember fellow fearful DBA&rsquo;s, NOSQL stands for &ldquo;Not Only SQL&rdquo; not for No &ndash; SQL as in SQL Void.</p></li>
<li><p>Embrace the awesome of Amazon S3. Ever wonder why Dropbox/JungleDisk and various other companies can give you so much storage for so cheap? Amazon S3 is pretty much the answer to that question. I typically use the cheapest hosting plans possible and S3 as a CDN to smoke/mirror performance.</p></li>
<li><p>SQL Server testing &ndash; Microsoft provides trial software for pretty much all their projects. If you are curious about &hellip; say playing with some feature of replication or maybe wondering about online indexing &hellip; Fire up 1 or more instances of EC2 and actually try it. You no longer have an excuse to put it off.</p></li>
<li><p>.Net testing or running a service &ndash; With shared hosting, I don&rsquo;t have a way of keeping an ongoing on demand service per say&hellip; So why not have a micro instance where you can deploy services and such. For example, say you need to add SMS services to your app&hellip;. Sign up for <a href="http://www.twilio.com/">Twilio</a>, create a little service, throw it on your free AWS EC2 instance and poll every hour or so. Most shared hosting sites don&rsquo;t really support SQL Server SSIS&hellip; so why not have an AWS EC2 instance that fires up at night and starts some SSIS packages?</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Now, some of this isn&rsquo;t without a learning curve, but we are in the software development industry&hellip; if we can&rsquo;t navigate learning curves or don&rsquo;t even pursue learning to begin with we add more nails to our career coffin as well as start becoming the problem.</p>

<p>I have tried ASP.NET MVC a couple times and after a couple hours seem to always roll back to webforms because it is &ldquo;easier&rdquo; or a time constraint or any number of excuses. However, last night I decided to change all that and really give MVC a fair chance. The more I tinker around in Ruby and iphone development the more I buy into the validity of the MVC approach. Here is a bit of the technology roadmap I want to drive down:</p>

<p><a href="http://mvccontrib.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=T4MVC">T4</a> &ndash; I hear about it, time to see what the fuss is about. Besides, <a href="http://twitter.com/davidebbo">David Ebbo</a> is the man.</p>

<p><a href="http://code.google.com/p/elmah/">Elmah</a> will be a proof of concept before I roll into <a href="http://www.exceptioneer.com/public/WhatIsExceptioneer.aspx">Exceptioneer</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/">S3</a> &ndash; I have already started playing around with this and love it. It will likely be serving the images and public files.</p>

<p>Routing &ndash; a vanity name like implementation for users will be my head first dive into routing.</p>

<p>Model &ndash; As a DBA, the data layer and ADO are my bread and butter. But it is time to step forward and see what the fuss is about. I will likely be trying out EF and <a href="http://subsonicproject.com/">Subsonic</a>.</p>

<p>Charting &ndash; I&rsquo;m a stat nerd, so I will be capturing stats, I hope to be able to throw some of them into the charting control.</p>

<p>NoSQL &ndash; I&rsquo;m not sure how to work it in yet, but at some point, I am planning on having a <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/simpledb/">SimpleDB</a>/<a href="http://ravendb.net/">RavenDB</a>/<a href="http://www.mongodb.org/">MongoDB</a> section just to explore and have knowledge outside of a half dozen tech articles.</p>

<p>Lastly, it is time to branch away from Web services and start playing around with WCF. This will really come into play for the iphone app being done in <a href="http://monotouch.net/">MonoTouch</a> which really is an exciting piece of work.</p>

<p>Once we are done with ASP.NET MVC, I plan to move to Ruby 3 and try and to build the same apps in that. Should be a great compare and contrast.</p>

<p>So that is it for now, time to see if I can stick to it and see this through&hellip; or give up and step back into web forms.</p>

<p>I have a great hosting provider &ndash; <a href="http://www.arvixe.com/">Arvixe</a> and they are on the ball for both my Linux hosting as well as my .NET stuff. So as I started cranking out apps and went to deploy I knew I could count on them to handle the hosting task at hand. So, compile&hellip; deploy&hellip; and we&rsquo;re erroring out. Oh! I forgot to set my site to integrated pipeline&hellip;. fix that, drop some control f5 and still an issue. So, CustomErrors=OFF, deploy and see that it is an error with the System.Web.MVC assembly. That&rsquo;s odd, well a google searching showed that this is a bit of known error. To fix, you simply click on the properties of that assembly, and set the &ldquo;copy local&rdquo; property to true. More information can be found here:<br/>
<a href="http://www.britishdeveloper.co.uk/2010/05/mvc2-deploy-could-not-load-file-or.html">This dudes blog</a><br/>
and from Haacked himself: <a href="http://haacked.com/archive/2008/11/03/bin-deploy-aspnetmvc.aspx">clickey</a></p>

<p>MVC ActionLink returns ?Length= &ndash; This was a real WTF for me. Turns out that if you specify a htmlattributes overload for ActionLink and don&rsquo;t put in something like null for the route values overload, it will append some stupid length=# string to your href.</p>

<p><code></p>

<pre><code>&lt;%: Html.ActionLink("Home", "Index", "Home", new { @class = "active" })%&gt;
</code></pre>

<p></code></p>

<p>Generates the following html:
<code></p>

<pre><code>&lt;a class="active" href="/?Length=4"&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>

<p></code></p>

<p>So we throw in null for the routeValues overload:
<code></p>

<pre><code>&lt;%: Html.ActionLink("Home", "Index", "Home", null ,new { @class = "active" })%&gt;
</code></pre>

<p></code></p>

<p>and we get the html we want.</p>
