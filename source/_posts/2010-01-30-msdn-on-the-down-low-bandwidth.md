For the most part, I find online [MSDN][1] to be a complete and utter slow pain in the compiler. It appears that MS has fixed this by offering 'low bandwidth' view for both [MSDN][1] and Technet. I am pleased to have this information tool back.

You can trigger this by click on the "Switch on low bandwidth view" link on [MSDN][1] or Technet.
