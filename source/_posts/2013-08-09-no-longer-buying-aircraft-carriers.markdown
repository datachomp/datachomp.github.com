I'm a hardware nut who likes both building and upgrading my dev boxes. I'm getting ready to refresh my box this year and the biggest difference - I'm no longer doing .NET/SQL Server. I'm also not on Windows.  
  
So what's different?  
  
**Remoting**  
Instead of a laggy/sluggish RDP sessions doing password dances, I'm all in with SSH and loving it.  
  
**IDE**  
Instead of the behemoth Visual Studio - I just use a text editor or bash or any number of focused tools that get out of my way.  

**Database**  
SQL Server is replaced with a lean Postgres and a tricked out [psql][1]. This still blows my mind and loving it every day.  

**OS**  
Instead of a fatty windows - I run [Ubuntu][5]. Ubuntu is not for everyone, I get that, so lets pretend that Ubuntu is some nasty monster - I can run [Crunchbang][4] and have a hyper focused OS that wants nothing more than to help me code. Speed wise, going from Windows 8 to something like [Crunchbang][4] is like going from a bicycle to a Ducati. The difference is further illustrated by the fact that I've been able to install versions of Linux that have the same memory footprint as just the Activation/License checker on Windows. I've often thought it would be cool if instead of more Windows Modern-UI for plebes, Microsoft had a more [OpenBox][3] type windows manager built on top of Server-Core. This would probably get me back on a Microsoft OS. Of course, by then, I might just be running everything off my [phone][6].
  
**Virtual Desktops**  
Having an OS with native virtual desktops is a complete joy. Sometimes I'm doing just data, sometimes I'm wallowing around in code, other times I'm browsing/social networking. Having dedicated desktops for this and not having to resort to 'I need a ton of monitors' Windows syndrome has been a welcome change as well.  
  
**Virtuals**  
Even when it comes to virtualization, gone are the days of heavy handed, GUI ridden 4GB of ram windows VM's... I can do extremely light, fast Linux VM's and ssh to them. It feels seamless and a lot of fun. And no comment on how cheaply I can offload a nice virtual [to the cloud][2] vs offloading Windows to the cloud.
  
For me, Linux is clean and focused and Windows is [Teletubbies][7]. As I go to build a new machine, breaking myself of the mentality of needing a 16 core, 24GB RAM dev box has been a welcome relief and it's nice to stop and smell the progress.
