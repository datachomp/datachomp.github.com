## Two guys walk into a language bar, the smart one unregister it

If you don't need the language bar, then uninstall it by:

`Start   Run   "regsvr32.exe /u msutb.dll"    (minus the quotes)`

Setting god mode in Windows 7  
Create a folder and rename it to :  
GodMode.{ED7BA470-8E54-465E-825C-99712043E01C}
