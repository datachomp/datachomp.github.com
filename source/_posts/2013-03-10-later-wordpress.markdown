I finally did it. I [imported all of my wordpress][1] entries into [Octopress][2] and I am rocking an awesome new blog engine. From my previous entry of stopping spam in contact, it might be obvious that my tolerance for wordpress was wearing thin. In addition, I recently moved the wordpress version to a $3/month server and learned very quickly that it buckles on loads greater than 40 concurrent users... and yes, that was with a configured supercache. I've also wanted another level of simplicity that wordpress can't provide. Unlike many of my data peers, I find that having a laughable DB like MySQL and pages being repeatedly generated by php to be incredibly silly. Part of being a good DBA is knowing when and when not to use a database and a simple tech blog is a silly reason to run one.
