I finally did it. I [imported all of my wordpress][1] entries into [Octopress][2] and I am rocking an awesome new blog engine. From my previous entry of stopping spam in contact form 7, it might be obvious that my tolerance for wordpress was wearing thin. In addition, I recently moved the WP version of datachomp to a $3/month server and learned very quickly that it buckles on loads greater than [40 concurrent users][3]... and yes, that was with a configured supercache. Get what you pay for right?

Right Tool for the Right Blog
---------------------
I have really wanted another level of simplicity that wordpress can't provide. Unlike many of my data peers, I find that having a laughable database like MySQL and pages being repeatedly generated by php to be incredibly silly. Part of being a good DBA is knowing when and when not to use a database and a simple tech blog is a silly reason to run one.
