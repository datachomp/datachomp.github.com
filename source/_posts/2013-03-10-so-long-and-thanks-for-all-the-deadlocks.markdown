It was about a year ago today when we launched the [Postgres episode][1] over at [Tekpub][2]. It is some of the most fun I have had building software and something I thought would be fun to do full time.

While getting ready to write this post, I saw the following exchange between .NET AppDevs talking about the .NET culture.
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>Right, now I'm wiser but too heavily invested. Either I or the platform has to change, I'm lazy, hoping its not me :)</p>&mdash; Demis Bellot (@demisbellot) <a href="https://twitter.com/demisbellot/status/309754561499906048">March 7, 2013</a></blockquote>

Demis is a .NET AppDev I love and truly respect and I really relate to fear of change by way of being "too heavily invested" in the Microsoft ecosystem. It is comforting and easy to hold on to what we already know. We do have one difference though and that I have decided to be the change in my situation. I have always felt that DBA's need to care more about their data than about their platform and I plan to really put that to the test in a few days. I've quit my luxurious and well paid job as a SQL Server DBA and will be going full time on Ruby and Postgres. I'll likely be taking a pretty decent pay cut, taking on more responsibility and having to learn a lot more... and that is ok. It's not the lazy route, but I feel it is the most rewarding. This should not be taken as a slam on SQL Server. It is a really good database but I want something that keeps pace with the web and doesn't involve me interpreting corporate licensing matrices. I want to build and ship software with talented people, not spend an AppDevs worth of salary for basic data compression. I want to give my apps some nice JSON love and SQL Server seems heavily focused on XML. SQL Server is also really focused on 3+ year release cycles so it isn't like I'll be falling behind. In fact, playing with Ruby and Postgres over the past year has kept me ahead of SQL Server and ASP MVC. I got to shove my donuts in my face while my fellow SQL Server DBA's were trying to figure out sequences in SQL Server 2012. So in short, SQL Server... it's not you, it's me. And I'm cool with that. I'll have to work a little harder, but it will be on my terms not yours. So long and thanks for all the deadlocks.
