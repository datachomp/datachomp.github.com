It seems like every place I go, companies are dropping an incredible amount money on an overpriced Verisign certificate which essentially proves nothing. I am not going to tirade on Verisign's prices, product, or just the general crappy nature of the company... but I will list alternatives:

The current ones I use and it rocks:  
For http SSL I use: [Start Com][1]  
For other services/protocols I tend to use:  
[CA Cert Org][2]

 [1]: http://cert.startcom.org/
 [2]: http://www.cacert.org/

I don't think cacert is any better/worse than startcom, I just mostly use cacert for internal stuff out of habit and I generally like the group.

Equally excellent CA's that are not free:  
[Dynadot.com][3]  
[Rapidssl.com][4]  
[Geotrust.com][5]
