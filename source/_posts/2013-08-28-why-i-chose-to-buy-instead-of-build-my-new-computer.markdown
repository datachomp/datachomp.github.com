For the last 15 year or so I've always built my own desktops. In the midst of the metric crap ton I've been having to learn the past couple months during my Microsoft delousing process, I realized that I didn't really want to deal with the feature matrix and code names associated with common hardware marketing.

=== Why not Dell?
The problem I've always had with trying to purchase prebuilt desktops is the lack of quality parts. I'm a huge fan of quailty power supplies like Seasonic and the like, and pretty much every power supply I see in prebuilt machines looks like it comes from the dollar store. In short, my computer is my livelithood and I like using nice things.

=== Support as a Service Desk
I've had so many bad experiences trying to find drivers, restore disks, any number of thing from traditional system builders that my first instinct when.   Before ordering, I had placed 4 sales questions over a variety of topics (What is the case like, when are do the Haswell's get in, power draw, etc)  and within minutes, the rep "Mark" would answer me directly on the information I asked about - the end.  No Upsell, no call to talk about it, no 'it's complicated' responses... I really appreciated this.

=== Price Tac Toe
A quick way to get me to hate buying a computer from you is to charge $200 for a 4GB ram upgrade. What ultimately sold me on System76 is the fact that the configuraton I wanted in their checkout cart... wasn't very different than the price of the configuration I wanted on NewEgg. This is where I hit the tipping point. I could have saved $75 or so by using NewEgg, putting it all together myself and rolling the RMA dice, but I felt like System76 had built up $75 worth of trust in the handling of my support questions that I figured I would give them a shot.

=== You can't force caring
I got my new machine in last night.
