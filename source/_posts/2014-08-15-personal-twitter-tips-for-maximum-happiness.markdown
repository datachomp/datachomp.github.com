##### Tip 1: Don't follow verified people.  
Don't follow verified people/accounts if possible. Someone who has done enough ego stroking
to become verified, likely has a fair number of followers. Let those people filter out the good stuff for you. Rest assured, if one of those accounts says something good, it will surface.

##### Tip 2: Mute hashtags often  
Amongst the chunks of good stuff on twitter are snowballs of drama and conferences/events you are not interested in. Luckily, most of these occurrences try to develop 'branding' with a hashtag. Mute them. In the event that muting is too much work, just simply logoff and do a puzzle or read a book.

##### Tip 3: Unfollow as easily as you follow  
Sometimes you will have a friend or someone you know change careers. They might start consulting or some other endeavor that requires them to 'brand-build', self promote or just generally create a lot of noise. Unfollow them. If it is someone you have a close relationship with, like a spouse or something, just mute them. If you find yourself following someone that is generally pretty negative, just unfollow them unless they do it in a particularly clever manner.

##### Tip 4: Don't use the twitter website.
Find a twitter client that stops the promoted tweets, 'we think you like this' tweets, blue-line/repeated conversation tweets, and the inane trending topics stuff. I use Tweetbot because I like how well it increases signal and decreases the above noise.
