I've never really thought about how bad of a blogger I am. I mean, I always knew deep in my heart I wasn't very good, but a few conversations over the past few months have really solidified just how bad I am. My confession begins.

#### Some Person in Somalia has Your Content
Over the years, I've seen a lot of emotional breakdowns and anger when someone sees their content reposted on bottom feeder sites. Some people have event pointed out to me when things from this blog appear on there. Each time this has happened, I've been unable to get angry or motivated enough to try to get it removed. I remember some people like Tom LaRock putting ridiculous 
"If you are not at thomaslarock.com, this material has been plagiarized by someone who steals content from others." Tynt scripts into his publicly pasted query and just being bewildered by the drama surrounding these episodes. For this lack of sharing without conditions and unwillingness to feign vitriol at a bot, I'm a bad blogger.

#### Always Be Tweeting
I don't tweet or retweet my same entry multiple times a day. I blame this partly on the fact
that I'm not a consultant nor have the self esteem issues needed to shamelessly market and remarket myself over and over. Another thing I do very poorly is submit a post to Hacker News and then stand on the tweet corner begging for upvotes. Because of this lack of pandering and repetitious pollution, I am a bad blogger.

#### Thanks for Writing My Opinion
me: 'Your post isn't any different than the press release.'  
blogger: "That is what they told us to say."  
To this day, the above conversation has never made sense to me. I'm always fascinated by people who do a repost of a marketing piece given to them and then celebrate what a prolific blogger they are. This apathy towards a raw number of blog posts as well as not being an echo chamber for a company on this blog is completely my fault and I apologize.

#### A Number of Reasons
"How many readers do you have?", "How do you tweak your SEO?", "How often do you reblog your most popular post?", "What is your peak time of day to release content?" and on and on. Barf. Some people think I'm just joking when I say I have no idea on the above questions, but it's the truth. More than pretty charts and clicks per minute, I tend to be more inspired by someone just saying 'hey dude, I checked out that thing on pgbouncer and it worked for me.' or being stuck on a smtp configuration in SSRS and searching this site for it. While this does cement that I'll never be an elite blogger, it does let me take acceptance that I'm just a bad blogger.

#### Truncate Table Opinions
There are a lot of reasons to blog, and for the most part mine are incredibly selfish. I blog to try to remember things, I blog so I can reference certain posts later... I blog to help put my thoughts into words and refine an opinion on something. The archive on this site might deceive you, but I tend to 'blog' at least once a week. A great majority of these never get published, but there is something therapeutic and reinforcing about writing something out or laying out a process into steps. If you want to get technical, you could say that I keep a journal that I sometimes publish out of and I wouldn't fight you on it. When you stop caring about others opinions or turning things into a popularity contest, you might be surprised at how easy "blogging" starts to become and how helpful it get in an industry that doesn't slow down. 

- This was a 10 minute journal entry that I just sort of decided to hit publish on. Goal was to have something to link when I get stuck in these silly conversation.
- Followed by 30 minutes or so of fixing typos because I'm illiterate.
