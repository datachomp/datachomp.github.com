![More Rob][1] 
I'm watching you AppDevs

He is the SQL Dude for Tekpub even though he failed all the 'tests', open source contributor to .NET Micro ORMS, speaker and can occasionally be found on This Developers Life. In his free time, he frequents various user groups in Oklahoma City or pretty much anywhere that has pizza.

When he isn't lording over AppDevs and Architects, he can be found truncating vast amounts of pizza, ETLing burritos and breaking down the execution plans of video games.
