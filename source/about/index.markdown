![More Rob][1] 
I'm watching you AppDevs

Rob is a bona fide Alpha Nerd and recent SQL Server DBA turncoat now operating in the Postgres world. He slings Ruby code around whever one lets him. He is the SQL Dude for Tekpub even though he failed all the 'tests', open source contributor to .NET Micro ORMS, speaker and can occasionally be found on This Developers Life. In his free time, he frequents various user groups in Oklahoma City or pretty much anywhere that has pizza.
