  <div class="entry-content"><h3>problem</h3>

<p>When your rails app barfs on an error, what goes into the app logs isn&rsquo;t pretty. Even with a basic routing error, you can count on 30 lines or so of stack junk going into your application log &ndash; much of what is inserted you don&rsquo;t care about. A lot of this junk comes from bots making php requests or just looking for low hanging fruit exploits. We need something to tune the signal to noise in our application logs as well as to stop wasting our apps time on bots.</p>

<h3>solution</h3>

<p>Just throw in a quick nginx location rule in your apps nginx config to catch and handle all the requests before they even hit your server.</p>

<pre><code>location ~ (\.php|.aspx|.asp|myadmin) {
    return 404;
}
</code></pre>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve always been a fan of the cleaner simpler ORMs. When I was getting started with Ruby, <a href="http://www.comiclist.com/media/blogs/news/AngryStayPuftBank.jpg">Active Record</a> was like putting my App in a fat suit. In the search for something leaner, I found <a href="https://github.com/jeremyevans/sequel">Sequel</a>. It reminded me a lot of <a href="https://github.com/robconery/massive">Massive</a> in .NET and at that point, everything in this world of Ruby started clicking.</p>

<h3>Iocane Powder</h3>

<p>Now that I am 100% on Postgres, Sequel can be made even sweeter (ie: faster) with the <a href="https://github.com/jeremyevans/sequel_pg">sequel_pg</a> gem. Like Iocane Powder, sequel_pg has no smell which means that you don&rsquo;t have to change any of your existing code. All you need to do is declare it in your Gemfile and get back to coding. If you are using Postgres, then your App will have a built up immunity to Iocane Powder making it safe to use. If your life blood is coursing with MySQL then adding sequel_pg can be an extremely fatal move. Though, that may not be a bad thing. <em>zing!</em></p>

<h3>Say Hello To My Little Friend</h3>

<p>Part of the absolute joy of using an object relational database like Postgres is&hellip; well, using objects. One of the coolest ways to turn our DB into Robocop is with an extension called <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/hstore.html">hstore</a> which allows for a Key-Value store inside our DB. Here is how flip the hstore switch and insert some data:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS hstore;  
CREATE TABLE kvburritos (id serial not null, details hstore not null, CONSTRAINT kvburritos_pkey PRIMARY KEY (id));

INSERT INTO kvburritos (details)
VALUES ('burritoname =&gt; "Postgres", toppings =&gt; "chicken, cheese, avacado, peppers", price=&gt; 4.50')
, ('burritoname =&gt; "MS Server", toppings =&gt; "chicken", price =&gt; "15.50"')
, ('burritoname =&gt; "Redis", toppings =&gt; "steak, cheese, spinach", price =&gt; "3.50"')
, ('burritoname =&gt; "Rethink", toppings =&gt; "egg, chorizo, bacon", price =&gt; "5.00"')
, ('burritoname =&gt; "Oracle", toppings =&gt; "gold, diamonds, elitism", price =&gt; "Call for a Quote"'); -- don't run this
</code></pre>

<p>Yay! I&rsquo;m not going to do any more examples in SQL since there are plenty to go around (or just use the documentation linked above). The problem we are faced with now, is that SQL does not necessarily help us out with Sequel&hellip;have fun reading that sentence out loud. Fear not, <a href="https://twitter.com/jeremyevans0">Jeremy Evans</a> and friends already have our back with extensions you can apply to Sequel. Check it out:</p>

<pre><code>require 'sequel'
Sequel.extension(:pg_hstore, :pg_hstore_ops, :pg_array)
DB = Sequel.connect(:adapter=&gt;'postgres', :host=&gt; 'localhost', :database=&gt;'burritomix', :user=&gt;'kencollins')
</code></pre>

<p>I put that array one on there for free. When we use this in our app, instead of a gutless, soulless, faceless hstore hash from the DB, we&rsquo;re getting awesome, tangible, huggable data:</p>

<pre><code>#our model:
#get the burritos that have cheese on them. Replace with Avacado in Production
@cheesylist = DB.fetch("SELECT * FROM kvburritos WHERE lower(details-&gt;'toppings') LIKE '%cheese%';")

#our view:
&lt;h2&gt;So Cheezy&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;% @cheesylist.each do |c| %&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;%= c[:details][:burritoname] %&gt; - &lt;%=  c[:details][:toppings] %&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;% end %&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
</code></pre>

<h3>Be still my beating DAL</h3>

<p>I love this! We can now build as fast as we want with semi structured data&hellip; and when our data becomes important and matures a little bit, we can easily break into relational schemas &ndash; Just as God intended.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When you are getting started in the world of Ruby web dev, one of the best things you can do is deploy to <a href="http://heroku.com">Heroku</a>.  However, if you find yourself having to deploy to a <a href="http://linode.com">VPS</a>, one of next best things you can do is use <a href="https://www.phusionpassenger.com/">Phusion Passenger</a>. It is an incredibly low friction application server for rack apps (and other things).</p>

<h3>Magic Strings of Wonderful Glory</h3>

<p>After you get your feet under you, you might find yourself needing to use more than the base modules that come with the nginx inside Passenger. As I would go to install or update Passenger, I would end up having to run something like this:</p>

<pre><code>gem install passenger

passenger-install-nginx-module --nginx-source-dir=/usr/src/nginx-1.5.3 ---with-http_ssl_module --with-http_gzip_static_module --with-http_stub_status_module --with --without-http_scgi_module --without-http_uwsgi_module --without-http_fastcgi_module --without-mail_pop3_module --without-mail_imap_module --without-mail_smtp_module --with-http_realip_module --add-module=/opt/nginxmodules/headers-more
</code></pre>

<p>This creates a few issues. Issue #1: I have to keep wget&#8217;ing new versions of source when I need to update.<br/>
Issue #2: I have a completely different workflow/scripts for managing a passenger nginx instance than I do for a unicorn/puma instance. This variance drives me nuts and be a source of script churn.</p>

<h3>Antacids</h3>

<p>I kept thinking there had to be a better way. Then the sky hash parted and a beam of light shown directly on a ppa from the brightbox team. This package uses a traditional installation of nginx, which means that I can easily install the nginx-extras package and get all my extra modules I need for load balancing and nginx_status. Here is how I do it:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install -y python-software-properties curl git-core  
sudo apt-add-repository -y ppa:brightbox/passenger-experimental  
sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install -y nginx-full  
sudo apt-get install -y nginx-extras  #extras headers and stuff  

\curl -L https://get.rvm.io | bash  
source ~/.profile  

rvm install 2.0.0-p247  
rvm --default use 2.0.0-p247  

sudo service nginx restart  
</code></pre>

<p>Most of how to do this is covered at:<br/>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For quite a few months now, I&rsquo;ve been playing around with a treadmill
desk. I have a pretty large hydraulic desk from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004TGWUPE/ref=oh_details_o02_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">Geek Desk</a> that I have
partitioned into 2 workstations:</p>

<p><a href="http://images.datachomp.com/treadmill/desktop.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://images.datachomp.com/treadmill/small_desktop.jpg" title="On Top of The Desk World" alt="On Top of The Desk World" Height="200" Width="400" /></a></p>


<p><strong>What is This?</strong><br/>
On the left is my coding/recording station, and on the right is my learning/gaming station.
When I&rsquo;m simply consuming content, I can easily work on my treadmill station. For $200, I bought a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004TGWUPE/ref=oh_details_o02_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">Confidence Power Plus</a> treadmill that I <a href="http://www.treadmilldeskdiary.com/setting-up-my-confidence-power-plus-treadmill-for-a-desk/">mostly disassembled</a> and slid under the desk. I have a master power switch I can trigger with my foot, and speed controls I can use from the desktop. The treadmill shuts itself off after 30 minutes of use which allows for a very lo-fi pomodoro system. When I first started on the treadmill station, which has no guard rails mind you, I had to go extremely slow and couldn&rsquo;t focus much on walking or consuming. Give it a bit though and the treadmill part falls right into muscle memory.</p>

<p><a href="http://images.datachomp.com/treadmill/underview.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://images.datachomp.com/treadmill/small_underview.jpg" title="Under the hood" alt="Under the hood" Height="200" Width="400" /></a></p>


<p><strong>These Reboots Were Made For Walking</strong><br/>
Since I know I will be tread&#8217;ing at some point in the day &ndash; and I know it will kill itself every 30 minutes &ndash; I&rsquo;ve been using tools like <a href="http://getpocket.com/">Pocket</a> and stuff to help me avoid distractions on my ~creation station~ because I know I can just punt it right over to the treadmill box and consume a lot of content distraction free. I am finally reaching a point where I can read at 2.8 mph, and watch screencasts at 4 mph. This makes me a huge fan of screencasts&hellip; They are better for me.</p>

<p><strong>tail -m thedragon</strong><br/>
Recently, I started adding games to the mix. If you are expecting to be able to play twitch games&hellip; Just stop that thought now. Any game that relies on twitch or precision is a no go. I&rsquo;m a huge fan of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxeW6urxLfY">Skyrim</a> and rpg&rsquo;s in general, but my current schedule/commits don&rsquo;t really allow me much indulgence in those time sinks. However, the need for a game that doesn&rsquo;t require heavy precision + the 30 minute cutoff on my treadmill allows an incredible pairing to occur.</p>

<p>Am I healthier because of my treadmill setup?  Maybe. Am I happier, more productive and having more fun? You bet!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;m a hardware nut who likes both building and upgrading my dev boxes. I&rsquo;m getting ready to refresh my box this year and the biggest difference &ndash; I&rsquo;m no longer doing .NET/SQL Server. I&rsquo;m also not on Windows.</p>

<p>So what&rsquo;s different?</p>

<p><strong>Remoting</strong><br/>
Instead of a laggy/sluggish RDP sessions doing password dances, I&rsquo;m all in with SSH and loving it.</p>

<p><strong>IDE</strong><br/>
Instead of the behemoth Visual Studio &ndash; I just use a text editor or bash or any number of focused tools that get out of my way.</p>

<p><strong>Database</strong><br/>
SQL Server is replaced with a lean Postgres and a tricked out <a href="http://www.craigkerstiens.com/2013/02/21/more-out-of-psql/">psql</a>. This still blows my mind and loving it every day.</p>

<p><strong>OS</strong><br/>
Instead of a fatty windows &ndash; I run <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a>. Ubuntu is not for everyone, I get that, so lets pretend that Ubuntu is some nasty monster &ndash; I can run <a href="http://crunchbang.org/">Crunchbang</a> and have a hyper focused OS that wants nothing more than to help me code. Speed wise, going from Windows 8 to something like <a href="http://crunchbang.org/">Crunchbang</a> is like going from a bicycle to a Ducati. The difference is further illustrated by the fact that I&rsquo;ve been able to install versions of Linux that have the same memory footprint as just the Activation/License checker on Windows. I&rsquo;ve often thought it would be cool if instead of more Windows Modern-UI for plebes, Microsoft had a more <a href="http://openbox.org/">OpenBox</a> type windows manager built on top of Server-Core. This would probably get me back on a Microsoft OS. Of course, by then, I might just be running everything off my <a href="http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/ubuntu-edge">phone</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Virtual Desktops</strong><br/>
Having an OS with native virtual desktops is a complete joy. Sometimes I&rsquo;m doing just data, sometimes I&rsquo;m wallowing around in code, other times I&rsquo;m browsing/social networking. Having dedicated desktops for this and not having to resort to &lsquo;I need a ton of monitors&rsquo; Windows syndrome has been a welcome change as well.</p>

<p><strong>Virtuals</strong><br/>
Even when it comes to virtualization, gone are the days of heavy handed, GUI ridden 4GB of ram windows VM&rsquo;s&hellip; I can do extremely light, fast Linux VM&rsquo;s and ssh to them. It feels seamless and a lot of fun. And no comment on how cheaply I can offload a nice virtual <a href="http://digitalocean.com">to the cloud</a> vs offloading Windows to the cloud.</p>

<p>For me, Linux is clean and focused and Windows is <a href="http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01399/teletubbies_1399692c.jpg">Teletubbies</a>. As I go to build a new machine, breaking myself of the mentality of needing a 16 core, 24GB RAM dev box has been a welcome relief and it&rsquo;s nice to stop and smell the progress.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The more I&rsquo;m around people building apps in Ruby or ruining their quality of life with PHP, the more I&rsquo;m seeing them actually use MySQL for something other than punch lines. As someone dedicated to trying to make the world a better place, I began looking for some easy ways to migrate from MySQL to <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/">Postgres</a>. This post will will not even pretend to be an exhaustive list for how to do this, but more based around me having 15 minutes of free time and some internet.</p>

<p>The first place I went looking was <a href="http://railscasts.com/episodes/342-migrating-to-postgresql">Railscasts</a> &ndash; They have a free intro episode to <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/">Postgres</a> and one of the tools they show is <a href="https://github.com/ricardochimal/taps">Taps</a>.  I gem&#8217;ed taps real quick and gave it a shot, but I couldn&rsquo;t get it to run due to port binding dependencies on my machine. No worries though, I still had plenty of tabs with search results so I moved on.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/ddollar/valkyrie">Valkyrie</a> was the next option I tried. I gem&#8217;ed it up, pointed it at the DB&rsquo;s and then it barfed on a &lsquo;mysql&rsquo; dependency (not to be confused with mysql2 gem dependency). I installed the &lsquo;mysql&rsquo; gem, ran it again and voilà! Migration complete! The command issued was very simple:</p>

<blockquote><p>valkyrie mysql://datachomp@localhost/seppuku?password=QuickAndPainless postgres://datachomp@127.0.0.1/seppuku</p></blockquote>

<p>A couple things I like about Valkyrie:</p>

<ul>
<li>It is simple. I just provide a mysql source and postgres destination.</li>
<li>It uses <a href="https://github.com/jeremyevans/sequel">Sequel</a>.</li>
<li>I can keep re-running it without it duplicating source data.</li>
</ul>


<p>If you are needing something more hardcore than a 1 time migration, the ever resourceful <a href="http://www.craigkerstiens.com/">Craig Kerstiens</a> suggested I check out <a href="https://code.google.com/p/tungsten-replicator/">Tungsten-Replicator</a>. Tungsten will essentially set up a read slave from MySQL to Postgres. Obviously, setup/configuration is going to be a bit more involved with Tungsten than a ~Fire-and-Forget~ migration tool like Valkyrie but remember, you are doing it for a good cause.</p>

<p>Now that you have seen an easy way to migrate away from MySQL, I encourage you to scan your network and start making the world a better place.</p>

While at <a href="http://waza.heroku.com/2013/">Waza</a> this year, I had a chance to talk to my friend <a href="http://twitter.com/groques/">Guillaume Roques</a>. In addition to talking about SalesForce, we took advantage of our mutual .NET backgrounds to discuss Microsoft. We did the typically uncompromising praise of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Guthrie">The Gu</a> and how far Azure has come along in the last 18 months&hellip; and of course we had to talk databases. Below is my quick little list of reasons I gave him as to why I&rsquo;m favoring Postgres over SQL Server from a technical/business aspect.</p>

<br />




<hr />


<ol>
<li><p>SQL Server still to this day deploys pessimistic concurrency out of the box. Anyone not aware of this &ldquo;feature&rdquo; starts out very disadvantaged on performance. This person will soon get an internet history filled with locking/blocking/deadlocking links. Postgres defaults to optimistic concurrency via its MVCC feature and is a joy to work with.</p></li>
<li><p>Compression out of the box. With SQL Server, compression is an &ldquo;Enterprise Edition and Up&rdquo; feature which means you are spending the cost of at least 1 dev in order to get the ability to use compression. Once you have paid for that ability, you still have to figure out how to implement it. Postgres does this for you out of the box, automatically and for free.</p></li>
<li><p>Concurrent Index Creation. You are going to find a recurring theme there&hellip;this is yet another feature that SQL Server is capable of doing, but only if you are able to afford the elite and affluent company of Enterprise Edition. Postgres has your back on this even if you left your wallet at home.</p></li>
<li><p>Partitioning out of the box. Our data is growing and we need to do something about it, but perhaps we don&rsquo;t want to take on the drama of sharding yet. Partitioning can be a pretty good fix for this and with Postgres, unsurprisingly, you get it out of the box. As for SQL Server, basic table partitioning is only available in Enterprise Elite edition. Yep, you&rsquo;re writing huge checks to pull this off.</p></li>
<li><p>Indexable functions &ndash; In Postgres, you can actually index certain functions and maintain sargability.  With SQL Server, you&rsquo;re stuck in the cruel world of table scans when this happens.</p></li>
<li><p>Modules/Extensions &ndash; Tech moves fast. The fact that Postgres has an extensions system means that your DB platform can now match the innovations on your web stack. SQL Server has releases every 3 years&hellip; It quickly becomes your grandparents&#8217; database.</p></li>
<li><p>Works everywhere &ndash; Linux, Mac, BSD, Windows&hellip; Postgres comes to you on the platform you want to code on. SQL Server is flexible in that it works on all 50 versions of Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8.</p></li>
<li><p>Arrays &ndash; Everyone loves arrays and they are a core part of programming&hellip;except in SQL Server, where they don&rsquo;t exist.</p></li>
<li><p>JSON / V8 support &ndash; You can write/use JSON and Javascript on the client, server and even your database if you are using Postgres. SQL Server? I believe they are still fully invested in thinking that XML is the future.</p></li>
<li><p>Unicode by default &ndash; No longer do you have to play the nvarchar / varchar implicit conversion game or have horrible string datatype mapping like you do in SQL Server. Postgres is UTF-8/varchar out of the box and wants nothing more than to give your app gigantic, unconditional data hugs.</p></li>
</ol>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It was about a year ago today when we launched the <a href="http://tekpub.com/productions/pg/">Postgres episode</a> over at <a href="http://tekpub.com/">Tekpub</a>, and it is some of the most fun I have had building software. I even joked about <a href="http://datachomp.com/archives/im-leaving-sql-server-for-postgres/">quitting SQL Server for Postgres</a>. Fast forward 12 months&hellip;it was less joking and more foreshadowing.</p>

<p>While getting ready to write this post, I saw the following exchange between some .NET AppDevs talking about the .NET culture.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>Right, now I&#8217;m wiser but too heavily invested. Either I or the platform has to change, I&#8217;m lazy, hoping its not me :)</p>&mdash; Demis Bellot (@demisbellot) <a href="https://twitter.com/demisbellot/status/309754561499906048">March 7, 2013</a></blockquote>


<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>


<p><a href="http://mythz.servicestack.net/">Demis</a> is a .NET AppDev I love and truly respect. I really relate to his fear of change by way of being &ldquo;too heavily invested&rdquo; in the Microsoft ecosystem. As someone who has been administering SQL Server for 10+ years, it is comforting and easy to hold on to what I already know. That being said, <a href="http://mythz.servicestack.net/">Demis</a> and I do have one difference &ndash; I have decided to be the change in my situation.</p>

<p>I have always felt that DBAs need to care more about their data than about their platform. I plan to really put that to the test in a few days. I&rsquo;ve quit my luxurious and well paid job as a SQL Server DBA and will be going full time on Ruby and <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/">Postgres</a>. I&rsquo;ll likely be taking a pretty decent pay cut, taking on more responsibility and having to learn a lot more&hellip; and that is ok. It&rsquo;s not the lazy route, but I feel it is the most rewarding.</p>

<p>This should not be taken as a slam on SQL Server. It is a really good database, but I want something that keeps pace with web/mobile and doesn&rsquo;t involve me interpreting corporate licensing matrices. I want to build and ship software with talented people, not spend an AppDevs worth of salary for features like basic data compression. I want to give my apps some nice JSON love and SQL Server seems to still think XML is the future.</p>

<p>Lastly, SQL Server is also really focused on 3+ year release cycles so at least I won&rsquo;t be worried that I&rsquo;ll be falling behind. In fact, playing with Ruby and Postgres has kept me ahead of SQL Server and ASP MVC. I got to shove my donuts in my face while my fellow SQL Server DBA&rsquo;s were trying to figure out sequences in SQL Server 2012.</p>

<p>So in short, SQL Server&hellip; it&rsquo;s not you, it&rsquo;s me. And I&rsquo;m cool with that. I&rsquo;ll have to work a little harder, but it will be on my terms not yours. So long, and thanks for all the deadlocks.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I finally did it. I <a href="https://github.com/benbalter/wordpress-to-jekyll-exporter">imported all of my wordpress</a> entries into <a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a> and I am rocking an awesome new blog engine. From my previous entry of stopping spam in contact form 7, it might be obvious that my tolerance for wordpress was wearing thin. In addition, I recently moved the WP version of datachomp to a $3/month server and learned very quickly that it buckles on loads greater than <a href="http://blitz.io/bgJW7CxbnCQFQ6ZUKQ4SwJQ">40 concurrent users</a>&hellip; and yes, that was with a configured supercache. Get what you pay for right?</p>

<h2>Right Tool for the Right Blog</h2>

<p>I have really wanted another level of simplicity that wordpress can&rsquo;t provide. Unlike many of my data peers, I find that having a laughable database like MySQL and pages being repeatedly generated by php to be incredibly silly. Part of being a good DBA is knowing when and when not to use a database and a simple tech blog is a silly reason to run one.</p>
