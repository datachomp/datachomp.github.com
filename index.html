  <div class="entry-content"><p>In my many years of Enterprise DBA servitude, there would be many instances of blanket &lsquo;the devs are idiots&rsquo; statements. Sometimes by me, sometimes by others and from the perspective of the database it was usually justifiable. In these enviornments, this is acceptable. I have no idea what busy work task they have come up with and why should I even care about anything out side of my database? These AppsDevs are disgusting dirty creatures that just sling filth everywhere as they stomp their hooves on the keyboard. Worthless.</p>

<h4>Inner Joined at the Hip</h4>

<p>What I enjoy most about the above mindset is the expectation of the AppDev to know their job and be equally proficient at my own. They must be fluent in the language of Stored Procedures else everything collapses from the data hate speech that comes from their object-pooriented programs. I&rsquo;ve often wondered where this one sidedness originated from. For a bit I thought it was just something that happened at places I worked. It&rsquo;s not just there though. Check out your local communities and you&rsquo;ll see the imbalance there as well. I attend both database user groups and developer based user groups. I often see a fair amount of AppDevs at sql events&hellip; I pretty much never see DBAs at developer events.</p>

<h4>Cross Apply What You Know</h4>

<p>A few years back, I got involved in with a few open source .NET ORMs. It goes without saying that ORMs are the <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2006/06/object-relational-mapping-is-the-vietnam-of-computer-science.html">Vietnam of the software world</a> and I was pretty much blown away at how desperate these projects were for feedback. It was so easy and fun to help out and it totally changed my opinion of ORMs. It also changed my opinion of the curmudgeoned DBA. If you want some contrast/perspective, I&rsquo;ve also helped out a few &lsquo;open source&rsquo; database projects by their prefered method &ndash; email.</p>

<h4>Refactor the  Query</h4>

<p>The more time you spend with AppDevs the more you realize just how many of them are stuck with really bad DBAs. Now when I hear DBAs complain I ask the following of them:
What open source work do you do?
What dev conferences do you attend with the team?
What have you personally built?
What source control do you use so that the team can see your scripts and ask about them?</p>

<p>You don&rsquo;t have to be Nostradamus to know how the people I&rsquo;m talking about answer the above questions. Like so many things with humans, the loud ones with the most generic argument are typically doing the least to fix the problem. If you are an Oracle/SQL Server DBA, don&rsquo;t just hide behind our industry specific firewalls &ndash; get out there. Engage the AppDevs, Review their code, help some project, make your scripts public for them to see. We&rsquo;ve sat in our foxholes long enough and the AppDevs are not our enemy. It&rsquo;s our turn to build the bridge.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>One of the issues we face at Raisemore is a continuous flux in our number of connections to our primary Postgres database. If our load increases and we have to spin up more front end servers or spin up more backend servers. This can quickly wreck our connection limit. One solution, is for me to babysit the connection size on the pg server itself&hellip; or perhaps I can give the Apps the middle finger and starve their connection limit &ndash; neither of these lead to happy outcomes for everyone involved.</p>

<h3>apt-get install happiness</h3>

<p>A better compromise is to just put a connection pooler like <a href="http://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/PgBouncer">PgBouncer</a> in front of our postgres database. In the same way we proxy our applications with Nginx, we can apply the same concept to our database(s) with Pgbouncer. Let&rsquo;s get started:</p>

<pre><code>--Assuming your pg database is already up and running
--databasename = burrito_hq  username = elguapo
sudo apt-get install -y pgbouncer
sudo nano /etc/pgbouncer/userlist.txt
&gt; "postgres" "postgres"
&gt; "elguapo" "hefe"
sudo nano /etc/pgbouncer/pgbouncer.ini
&gt; [databases]
&gt; burrito_hq = host=localhost port=5432 dbname=burrito_hq user=elguapo password=hefe
&gt; [pgbouncer]
&gt; listen_addr = *
&gt; auth_type = md5
&gt; admin_users = postgres
&gt; stats_users = postgres
</code></pre>

<p>Above are some of the settings I changed to get started. As you get more familiar with Pgbouncer, change the <a href="http://pgbouncer.projects.pgfoundry.org/doc/config.html">various settings</a> as you see fit and for your workload.<br/>
Let&rsquo;s test our settings by firing up PgBouncer. PgBouncer is closely tied to the postgres user on the server, so we&rsquo;ll &lsquo;switch user&rsquo; into the postgres account to crank it up:</p>

<pre><code>sudo su postgres -c"pgbouncer -d /etc/pgbouncer/pgbouncer.ini"
</code></pre>

<p>On our client machine, lets attempt a connection to our server which has an ip of 172.16.150.128:</p>

<pre><code>psql -h 172.16.150.128 -p 6432 -U elguapo -d burrito_hq 
</code></pre>

<p>and hopefully we&rsquo;re in!  Once we know our settings are in good shape, lets turn PgBouncer auto start mode on:</p>

<pre><code>sudo nano /etc/default/pgbouncer
&gt; START=1
sudo reboot #reboot the box to test it out
</code></pre>

<p>When the server comes back online, hopefully you can connect again from the client. Now that the server is stable again, we can go get completely lost in the <a href="http://pgbouncer.projects.pgfoundry.org/doc/usage.html">documentation</a> and let the tool really shine.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It starts with the all too familiar &ldquo;I think my database is running slow&rdquo; and ends with the AppDev and myself speaking different languages, yelling at each and saying hurtful things&hellip; all the while the app and db sit in their servers neglected and needing love.</p>

<h3>pg_therapy</h3>

<p>While many of us that live in the database layer have tricked out <a href="https://github.com/datachomp/dotfiles/blob/master/.psqlrc">.psqlrc</a> files, I rarely find AppDevs with the same. Let me stress that this is perfectly ok!!! But having some really ugly diagnostic queries aliased in your .psqlrc is incredibly helpful. Majority of the AppDevs I talk to concerned about their db also happen to be running on Heroku. To accomodate its users, Heroku has put out a very helpful plugin to their toolbelt called <a href="https://github.com/heroku/heroku-pg-extras">pg-extras</a>. I love this tool because it gets the AppDev and I on a common language. They don&rsquo;t get scared by hairy SQL statement and it&rsquo;s consistent from app to app. Check it out:</p>

<h3>Pump you up</h3>

<p>Installation is a breeze:</p>

<pre><code>heroku plugins:install git://github.com/heroku/heroku-pg-extras.git
</code></pre>

<p>Using it a breeze:</p>

<pre><code>heroku pg:bloat  #one of my favorites!
</code></pre>

<p>When I run that, it tells me that I didn&rsquo;t specify a database:<br/>
! Unknown database. Valid options are: HEROKU_POSTGRESQL_BLACK_URL, HEROKU_POSTGRESQL_PINK_URL</p>

<p>I run it again with the proper db:</p>

<pre><code>heroku pg:bloat HEROKU_POSTGRESQL_BLACK_URL
</code></pre>

<p>Now I have an easy to use snapshot of our database that has an incredibly low barrier of entry to execute for myself or anyone. Let&rsquo;s say that the person running it doesn&rsquo;t trust me or perhaps I&rsquo;m in a burrito coma, they can always refer to the <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-postgres-database-tuning">heroku database tuning site</a> and get sound information.</p>

<h3>Dude, I don&rsquo;t even have time for that.</h3>

<p>Maybe the above is a bit too much to stomach. That&rsquo;s cool, we&rsquo;ll just flip another easy switch:</p>

<pre><code>heroku addons:add librato
</code></pre>

<p><a href="http://librato.com">Librato</a> is a beautiful dashboard that is fun to look at, easy to use and will give us some historical context for troubleshooting the typically ill fated &ldquo;I think my database is slow&rdquo; situation. What is nice about tooling like Librato is not only does it show our db stats, we also get the context of the Application(Dyno&rsquo;s, router latency, etc). For more information on this, checkout Craig Kerstiens post on <a href="https://postgres.heroku.com/blog/past/2013/10/9/monitoring_your_heroku_postgres_database/">Monitoring with Librato</a>.</p>

<h3>Hugs and Queries</h3>

<p>I love this type of solution because it gets us looking at hard numbers and can easily as well as objectively say it is the DBs fault, the Apps fault, heroku&rsquo;s fault, or no ones fault and everything is fine. Librato and Postgres don&rsquo;t keep track of our egos, our mood or our fatigue &ndash; they keep us honest and on topics that really matter&hellip; something we all could use a little more of.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Like many rubyists, I have a hard time keeping up with which burrito truck is parked outside my house on any given day. In postgres, I&rsquo;ve solved this by entering the trucks and the duration they will be staying parked outside in my database:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE TABLE burritotrucks
(
  id serial primary key,
  truckname text not null,
  onsite daterange not null --or tsrange if busy schedule
);

insert into burritotrucks (truckname, onsite)
values ('thumpy tortillas', '[2013-11-15, 2013-11-17]'),
('chompy delight', '[2013-11-15, 2013-11-17]'),
('no dogs allowed', '[2013-11-16, 2013-11-21]'),
('government cheese wagon', '[2013-11-11, 2013-11-14]'),
('tortuga mochilla', '[2013-11-13, 2013-11-18]');
</code></pre>

<p>There are a variety of operators to query <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/rangetypes.html">range types</a>, but for this example, I&rsquo;ll just be using the <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/functions-range.html">contains operator</a>:</p>

<pre><code>select * from burritotrucks where onsite @&gt; now()
</code></pre>

<p>Uh oh, it&rsquo;s not working. Unlike the other range types, date ranges require a little more finesse. Postgres doesn&rsquo;t quite trust the implicit conversion so we&rsquo;ll just do a little hand holding:</p>

<pre><code>select * from burritotrucks where onsite @&gt; now()::date
</code></pre>

<p>It works! But how do we do this in our application with <a href="https://github.com/jeremyevans/sequel">Sequel</a>? First, we let <a href="https://github.com/jeremyevans/sequel">Sequel</a> know we&rsquo;re going to be using the range extensions:</p>

<pre><code>Sequel.extension(:pg_range)
DB = Sequel.connect(:adapter=&gt;'postgres', :host=&gt; 'localhost'
, :database=&gt;'frontyard', :user=&gt;'dc')
</code></pre>

<p>We query the database:</p>

<pre><code>options = DB[:burritotrucks].all
p options
</code></pre>

<p>and we get the data. We can see how beautifuly <a href="https://github.com/jeremyevans/sequel">Sequel</a> handles the range type for us in the printed output and at this point we can get away with using our raw sql to get the data we need:</p>

<pre><code>options = DB.fetch("select * from burritotrucks where onsite @&gt; now()::date").all
p options
</code></pre>

<p>This works, but I can imagine many AppDevs becoming ill at the sight of SQL in their app. In order to appease both sides of the aisle, <a href="https://github.com/jeremyevans/sequel">Sequel</a> also has some pretty ruby friendly operators we can use by just adding the core_extensions as well as the range operators extension:</p>

<pre><code>Sequel.extension(:core_extensions, :pg_range, :pg_range_ops)
DB = Sequel.connect(:adapter=&gt;'postgres', :host=&gt; 'localhost'
, :database=&gt;'frontyard', :user=&gt;'dc')
</code></pre>

<p>Now we can get much more ruby friendly queries. Note, We still need to cast for our date value but that is pretty trivial:</p>

<pre><code>options = DB[:burritotrucks].where(:onsite.pg_range.contains(Sequel.cast(Date.today, Date))).all
p options
</code></pre>

<p>People often ask me why I like <a href="https://github.com/jeremyevans/sequel">Sequel</a> so much and this is another great example why. It doesn&rsquo;t punish me for knowing SQL. It doesn&rsquo;t punish postgres for having so many amazing features and data types. It easily lets me know how many burrito trucks I have in my yard which is something you can not put a value on.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Postgres is filled to the brim with awesome features, but they don&rsquo;t make sense for every occasion. I posted last night about my <a href="http://datachomp.com/archives/my-friend-rob/">Thankyou app</a> and it happens to have a use case for writable <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/queries-with.html">CTEs (Common Table Expression)</a>.<br/>
First, lets new up some data:</p>

<pre><code>drop table if exists thanks;
create table thanks (
    id serial primary key,
    who text not null,
    picked boolean not null default 'false',
    created_at date default now(),
    last_picked date default '-infinity'
);

insert into thanks (who)
values ('rob conery'), ('postgres'), ('sidekiq'), ('demis bellot'), ('sinatra')
, ('josh berkus'), ('elizabeth naramore'), ('amir rajan'), ('sequel');

select * from thanks;
</code></pre>

<p>Boom! This app selects a random person or project I&rsquo;m thankful for that hasn&rsquo;t already been picked or hasn&rsquo;t been picked in the last 9 months. Here it is in code form:</p>

<pre><code>select * from thanks where picked = false or last_picked &lt; now() - interval '9 months';
</code></pre>

<p>Now we can put it in a normal CTE:</p>

<pre><code>with guesswho as (
    select * from thanks 
    where picked = false or last_picked &lt; now() - interval '9 months')
select guesswho.id, guesswho.who
from guesswho;
</code></pre>

<p>Yes!!! Let&rsquo;s pick a random row. For our randomizer, I would like a lovely set of sequential id&rsquo;s I can pick from. Since we can&rsquo;t completely trust the primary key id&rsquo;s returned in our CTE (especially as rows start to get trimmed off), we&rsquo;re going to throw a row_number function on, as well as pass our first CTE into a second CTE to generate a random number based on the result set:</p>

<pre><code>with guesswho as (
    select ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY id) as champs, * 
    from thanks where picked = false or last_picked &lt; now() - interval '9 months')
, onlyone as (select trunc(random() * count(0) + 1) as tops from guesswho)
select guesswho.id, guesswho.who
from guesswho, onlyone
where champs = onlyone.tops;
</code></pre>

<p>Yay!!! We&rsquo;re getting data we love on projects we love. But where does the writable CTE come into play? How cool would it be if we could also mark the record we&rsquo;re selecting as picked, so we don&rsquo;t have to make an additional call to the DB to flag afterwards? Check it out:</p>

<pre><code>with guesswho as (select row_number() over (order by id) as champs, * 
    from thanks where picked = false or last_picked &lt; now() - interval '9 months')
, onlyone as (select trunc(random() * count(0) + 1) as tops from guesswho)

, adios as (update thanks set picked = 'true', last_picked = now() from guesswho, onlyone where thanks.id = guesswho.id and 
guesswho.champs = onlyone.tops RETURNING thanks.picked)

select guesswho.id, guesswho.who
from guesswho, onlyone, adios
where champs = onlyone.tops;
</code></pre>

<p>So.Much.Awesome! Check out that 3rd CTE we added (adios), is using our previous CTE&rsquo;s, updating the row we chose, as well as providing a returning statement of what it updated. The returning statement provides context for what happened inside that writable CTE to alleviate confusion between table expresisons. Feel free to play with it on your own machine and especially change the data for the people or tech you&rsquo;re thankful for.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&rsquo;s been a little over 6 months since I left .Net and one of the personal concerns I had with Postgres/Ruby was how long it would be before I started getting complacent and taking everything for granted.</p>

<h3>Always Be Coding</h3>

<p>To counteract this concern, I made a little database full of projects and people I&rsquo;m thankful for. You&rsquo;ll see projects like sidekiq, hstore, pg_stat_statements, sinatra and you&rsquo;ll also see people like Josh Berkus, Ryan Bates, Demis Bellot… It&rsquo;s become a pretty big table because I&rsquo;m thankful to so many. I also made a little console app to pick a random row and email it to me once a week because what good is data if you don&rsquo;t use it?</p>

<h3>It Passes in a Flash</h3>

<p>The past few months have been amazing. The team I work with at Raisemore is top notch and it is an incredible feeling to be working with and helping non-profits every day. Tekpub got acquired by Pluralsight. That experience has been a lot of work and an absolute blast building videos with them. I&rsquo;ve also helped reboot our local Ruby user group with 2 other friends and spoke to that group today on two topics I absolutely love &ndash; Sequel and Postgres.</p>

<h3>For Whom The Phone Tolls</h3>

<p>We just got back from dinner and I&rsquo;m checking my usual blog posts and nightly reading when I get the familiar email every Friday at 00:00:00 UTC:<br/>
Subject: Be Thankful<br/>
Body: 1 &ndash; Rob Conery</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it gets anymore serendipitous than that. Rob is the first entry I put in the table. Since I&rsquo;ve met Rob, he has challenged me to be a better DBA, challenged my comfort zones and to be an overall better person. Some of the above he&rsquo;s done directly, some of it indirectly and I&rsquo;m thankful for all if it.</p>

<h3>perspective.empty?</h3>

<p>I can&rsquo;t wait to see who/what shows up in my inbox next week. I can&rsquo;t wait to reflect on what is was that connected with me. When I get the next mail, I don&rsquo;t know yet if I&rsquo;ll take the time to personally thank them or the project. What I do know is that between now and when I get my next mail, I hope that I can have the same effect on others my list has had on me.</p>

<p>Thanks AP, for breaking and basically telling me nothing. Luckily, it doesn&rsquo;t have to be this way. If we take a moment to stop and get to know AP, we can get it to open up and be more helpful to us. We start by setting our bundler editor in .bashrc by adding the following line:</p>

<pre><code>bundle open sprockets  #sprockets is AP's birth name
</code></pre>

<p>Navigate to lib->sprockets->base.rb</p>

<p>find your way to the &ldquo;def each_entry(root, &amp;block)&rdquo; section of code and you&rsquo;ll likely see a lack of error handling there. To fix it, I wrap a rescue around the &ldquo;directory?&rdquo; check like so:</p>

<pre><code>begin
    if stat(path).directory?
      each_entry(path) do |subpath|
        paths &lt;&lt; subpath
      end
    end
    rescue
      puts "Hey friend, I have an issue at: #{path}"
    end
end
</code></pre>

<p>This doesn&rsquo;t fix all of AP&rsquo;s problems, none of us are perfect, but it does coax the gem into letting us know where the problem is. Once we know where the problem is, we can work on it together rather than just throwing our arms up in the air and quitting.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today, I found myself in a horrible situation. I was heading down i-235 and I became stricken with an insatiable burrito urge. All the apps on my phone were borked and all I had was my trusty Postgres database. I needed to find a burritos shop and I needed to find one fast.</p>

<h4>Where oh where to begin</h4>

<p>Luckily, I happen to know the latitude and longitude of all my favorite burrito places in Oklahoma City. I quickly add them to my database:</p>

<pre><code>--Hello Table!
CREATE TABLE burritoplaces
(id serial PRIMARY KEY,
establishment varchar(50) not null,
lat double precision,
lon double precision);  
--Hello Data!
INSERT INTO burritoplaces(establishment, lat,lon)
VALUES ('Verde Bueno Burrito', 35.484388,-97.505035)
,('Locos Lobos', 35.496025,-97.510185)
,('Captain Crustacean', 35.51468,-97.524347)
,('Double Stuffers Cafe', 35.523762,-97.508039)
,('Cafe Truncate of Watonga', 35.866413,-98.473206);
</code></pre>

<p>The data checks out:</p>

<pre><code>-- all 5 entries
SELECT * FROM burritoplaces;
</code></pre>

<p>Perfect! All my favorite places are there but sadly, I can&rsquo;t do geospatial math in my head. I can&rsquo;t even really do it outside of my head so I&rsquo;m going to have to get some help. Enter the <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/earthdistance.html">earthdistance</a> postgres extension and its helpful sibling &lsquo;cube&rsquo;:</p>

<pre><code>--turn on the magic
CREATE EXTENSION cube;
CREATE EXTENSION earthdistance;
</code></pre>

<p>I&rsquo;m becoming so weak&hellip; I need to wrap this up. Since I live in one of the four countries in the world that uses the Imperial system of measurement, I need to figure out how to do this whole thing in miles. Skimming over the earthdistance documentation, it looks like I just need to use the point commands. I whip up a query that is as tech tasty as some carne asada:</p>

<pre><code>-- my location on i-235 is a very hungry (35.512363,-97.515678)
SELECT *, point(-97.515678, 35.512363) &lt;@&gt; point(lon, lat)::point AS burrito_distance
FROM burritoplaces
WHERE (point(-97.515678, 35.512363) &lt;@&gt; point(lon, lat)) &lt; 10 --feel free to play this!
ORDER by burrito_distance;
</code></pre>

<p>This returns me everything that is less than 10 miles away and orders them by distance. I see that Captain Crustacian is a half mile away and they have amazing guacamole. Thank you Postgres, cube, and earthdistance. You have saved my life once again.</p>

<p>If I lived anywhere else in the world, I would likely use meters and write the query as such:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT *, earth_distance(ll_to_earth(35.512363,-97.515678), ll_to_earth(lat, lon)) as burrito_distance
FROM burritoplaces
WHERE earth_box(ll_to_earth(35.512363,-97.515678), 4000) @&gt; ll_to_earth(lat, lon)
ORDER by burrito_distance;
</code></pre>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When I was in the .net world, I was pretty adamant about the importance of giving your App a nice <a href="http://datachomp.com/archives/application-connection-ocd/">application_name</a> to help out your DBA. Now that I&rsquo;m in the ruby/postgres world, the same still holds true.</p>

<p>As much as I want to like ActiveRecord, I can&rsquo;t seem to get past anything more than a casual friendship with it. My tool of choice is <a href="https://github.com/jeremyevans/sequel">Sequel</a>. One of the problems with Sequel is that setting the application name isn&rsquo;t very intuitive. Luckily, the awesome maintainer <a href="https://twitter.com/jeremyevans0">Jeremy Evans</a>, pointed me in the right direction with the :after_connect option. Check it out:</p>

<pre><code>require 'sequel'
DB = Sequel.connect(:adapter=&gt;'postgres', :host=&gt; 'localhost'
, :database=&gt;'datachomp', :user=&gt;'rob', :max_connections =&gt; 10
, :after_connect=&gt;(proc do |conn| conn.execute("SET application_name TO 'dbahugs'") end))
</code></pre>

<p> When I look at my pg_stat_activity, I&rsquo;m able to filter down properly and predictably:</p>

<pre><code>select * from pg_stat_activity where application_name = 'dbahugs'
</code></pre>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Modules and extensions are one of the awesome features that keep Postgres so relevant in modern development. Need GUIDs? Just add the extension and you&rsquo;re off to the races:</p>

<pre><code>select * from pg_available_extensions where name = 'uuid-ossp'; -- check for uuid-ossp
create extension "uuid-ossp"; -- it's alive!
</code></pre>

<p>and to make sure it&rsquo;s active:</p>

<pre><code>select * from pg_extension; -- we should see it listed
</code></pre>

<p>But not all extensions are created equal. If you live in DBA world, one of the extensions you come to lean on is the <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/pgstatstatements.html">pg_stat_statements</a> extenion. This extension gives you  deeper view of what has been running in your database. Adding it to a database is easy enough:</p>

<pre><code>create extension "pg_stat_statements";
select * from pg_stat_statements;  
</code></pre>

<p>Uh oh, we&rsquo;re greeted with a error that can be a little intimidating:<br/>
<font color=red>ERROR:  pg_stat_statements must be loaded via shared_preload_libraries</font></p>

<p>Ummmm what? Some extensions have special needs that require us to alter our configuration for our entire Postgres instance. pg_stat_statements has some additional memory requirements that need to be satisfied on startup thus requiring us to add it to the shared_preload_libraries. If we&rsquo;re on Ubuntu, we make sure we have our contrib module installed:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install -y postgresql-contrib-9.3
</code></pre>

<p>Head on over to our configuration at /etc/postgresql/9.3/main/postgres.conf and look for the shared_preload_libraries setting and reference the extension:</p>

<pre><code>shared_preload_libraries = 'pg_stat_statements' # (change requires restart)
</code></pre>

<p>This works great for us trench diggers on Linux, but what about the AppDev&rsquo;s that can&rsquo;t be separated from their Mac&rsquo;s? If you are on a Mac, I sincerely hope you&rsquo;re using the awesome <a href="http://postgresapp.com/">Postgres.App</a>, but finding the config for it isn&rsquo;t straight forward. Luckily, Postgres has our back. Connect to your instance of Postgres.app and run the following:</p>

<pre><code>show all;        -- This is a list of a bunch of settings... whoa!
show config_all; -- Ahhhh, here is what we want
</code></pre>

<p>Now that we have the location of our configuration file, just throw it into the Unholy Explorer(AKA Finder), start scrolling the file and add the pg_stat_statements setting to the shared_preload_libraries.</p>

<h4>buyer beware</h4>

<p>This works wonderfully in Postgres.app 9.3.0.0. In earlier versions of the app, it does has issues finding the contrib modules. This is a bit of a bummer and when I get my act together, I&rsquo;ll file an issue. Of course, you&rsquo;re more than welcome to beat me to the punch.</p>
